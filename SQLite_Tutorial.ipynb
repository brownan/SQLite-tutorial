    "Welcome to my SQLite tutorial, but it is also a generic SQL primer. It is aimed at those familiar with programming but with no experience with relational databases. It covers using SQL as a data storage and query system, assuming you already have datasets in CSV format that you would like to query and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future tutorial will cover how to interface with SQLite from Python and use a relational database as a data storage and manipulation layer for your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook with a SQLite backend. We'll be typing commands here into a sqlite3 shell, which you can follow along at home by executing the `sqlite3` command on your command line, or by installing Jupyter and the [SQLite backend](https://github.com/brownan/sqlite3-kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the ``sqlite3`` command is executed with no parameters, we interface with an in-memory database that disappears when you exit. It's handy for experimenting, but we have to create all our tables and import all our data each time.\n",

    "* A relational database organizes its data into *tables*, sometimes called *relations*.\n",
    "* Each table is made up of a fixed number of *columns* and zero or more *rows*\n",
    "* Each column has a name, and generally has a data type (SQLite is a bit lenient on data types, but a good database design keeps a uniform type on every row in a column)\n",
    "* A table usually has a *primary key*—a column or set of columns that is used to uniquely identify a row. Each row primary key must be unique througout that table."

First is just the principle of having data organized into tables of a single purpose. But more importantly is to reduce duplication of data. If you had demographic data in the grades table, it would duplicate all the demographic data for every course a student takes, which makes it harder to change, and introduces consistency issues if the data doesn't match in every row. It's better to have one authorative source for data and let the database worry about joining and cross referencing when necessary.\n",
